# **Decentralized Counter DApp: A Full-Stack Blockchain Application**

This project presents a robust and interactive Decentralized Application (DApp) that demonstrates core blockchain interaction. It features a foundational Solidity smart contract for a simple counter, coupled with a responsive React frontend for seamless user interaction. This setup provides a clear illustration of how a frontend can connect with and manage state on a blockchain, perfect for showcasing full-stack DApp development capabilities.

## **Installation**

Getting this DApp up and running locally is straightforward. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   ‚úÖ **Node.js & npm**: For managing frontend dependencies.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Foundry**: For compiling, testing, and deploying the Solidity smart contracts. Follow the official installation guide [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

### üöÄ Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd base_scrabble
```

### üì¶ Install Contract Dependencies
Navigate into the `contract` directory and install the necessary Solidity dependencies using Foundry's `forge`:
```bash
cd contract
forge install
forge build
```

### üíª Install Frontend Dependencies
Now, move into the `frontend` directory and install the React application's dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## **Usage**

Once the project dependencies are installed, you can interact with the DApp.

### üåê Deploy the Smart Contract
To deploy the `Counter` smart contract to a local blockchain (like Anvil, included with Foundry) or a testnet, use the Foundry script:
1.  **Start a local blockchain (if not already running)**:
    ```bash
    anvil
    ```
2.  **Deploy the contract**:
    Open a new terminal and run the deployment script. Replace `<YOUR_RPC_URL>` with your blockchain's RPC URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8545` for Anvil) and `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with a private key of an account with funds (e.g., one of Anvil's default accounts).
    ```bash
    forge script script/Counter.s.sol --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL> --broadcast --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
    ```
    *Note: The deployment output will provide the deployed contract address. You'll need this address to connect your frontend.*

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Frontend Application
With the contract deployed, start the React development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

### ü§ù Interacting with the DApp
On the frontend, you'll find an interface to:
*   **View the current counter value** from the deployed smart contract.
*   **Increment the counter**: Send a transaction to increase the counter's value on the blockchain.
*   **Set a new number**: Update the counter to a specific value via a blockchain transaction.

## **Features**

*   üî¢ **Simple Counter Logic**: A Solidity smart contract that manages a single `uint256` counter variable, allowing for incrementing and setting its value.
*   üîó **Blockchain Interaction**: Seamless integration between the React frontend and the deployed Solidity contract for reading and updating blockchain state.
*   ‚öõÔ∏è **Responsive Frontend**: Built with React and Vite for a fast and modern development experience, providing an intuitive user interface.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Robust Smart Contract Development**: Utilizes Foundry for a comprehensive development toolkit, including advanced testing and scripting capabilities.
*   ‚ö° **Efficient Tooling**: Leverages Vite for lightning-fast development server and build times.
