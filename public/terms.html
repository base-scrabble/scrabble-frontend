  <h1>Terms of Service for Base Scrabble</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 26, 2025</p>
  <p>
    Base Scrabble is an <strong>early-access</strong> onchain word game. By accessing or using Base Scrabble (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms.
    If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Early Access / “As Is”</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Features may change, break, or be removed at any time.
    We do not guarantee uptime, match availability, performance, or that the Service will be error-free.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Free Mode and Future Modes</h2>
  <p>
    Base Scrabble may include a free-to-play experience. We may also introduce additional game modes or optional features in the future.
    Nothing in these Terms is a promise that any specific mode or feature will be available now or in the future.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploit bugs, cheat, or automate gameplay in a way that harms the Service or other players.</li>
    <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users.</li>
    <li>Attempt to access accounts, systems, or data you are not authorized to access.</li>
    <li>Use the Service for unlawful purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Onchain Interactions</h2>
  <p>
    Some parts of the Service may interact with public blockchains (including Base) through your wallet.
    Onchain actions are irreversible and may require paying network fees (gas). You are responsible for your wallet, keys, and all transactions you approve.
  </p>

  <h2>5. No Financial Promises; No Contests</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is a game. We do not make any promises of profits, financial returns, rewards, or compensation.
    The Service is not a contest, sweepstakes, DeFi product, or investment offering.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The Service and its content (including software, artwork, branding, and game design) are owned by Pama Global Labs and/or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws.
    You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service except as allowed by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time if we believe you violated these Terms or if we need to protect the Service or users.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Pama Global Labs will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
    or any loss of data, loss of goodwill, or loss arising from your use of (or inability to use) the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
